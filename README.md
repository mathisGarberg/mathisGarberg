### Hi 👋👨‍💻

Mathis started as a web developer in Telenor in 2017, and been exposed to several technologies during his career. 

I'm currently consulting for the a Norwegian telecom operator called ICE, where we're building software for sales agents.

I'm currently learning unit testing with Jasmine and Karma in Angular, and want to make this an automated part of my workflow.

I'm looking to colleborate on best practices in the Angular community.

Ask me about anything that has to do with Angular.
